 **3** | Order Processing       | Full Checkout | TS-12           | Checkout              | Successful Full Checkout with Mock Payment: Given I have items in the cart and enter all valid billing/shipping details, When I complete the checkout process, Then the order should be created.    | The order status should transition to Pending in the Admin panel.                              | Yet To be Determined 
 **4** | Order Processing       | Full Checkout | TS-13           | Checkout (Validation) | Attempt Checkout with Missing Shipping Address: Given all fields are complete except for the shipping address, When I proceed to the next step, Then an error must be displayed.                    | Must show a field validation error prompting the user to complete the shipping address.        | Yet To be Determined 
 **5** | Order Processing       | Full Checkout | TS-14           | Order Status          | Attempt to Skip Order Status: Given an order is in 'Pending' status (in the Admin panel), When I attempt to manually change the status directly to 'Complete', Then the system behavior is checked. | System should prevent skipping unless allowed by business logic (checking system constraints). | Yet To be Determined
